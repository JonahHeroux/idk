  <h1>Excellent!</h1>
  
 Congratulations, you've proven your skill in a game of luck! Your victory may be a glimmer of hope, but the kidnapper is far from finished with you. The light at the end of the tunnel is bright and inspiring, yet distant. Speaking of tunnels, the basement in which you've been imprisoned has four of them. One is the path to freedom, and three lead to certain doom.
  <p>Peering through each tunnel, you attempt to get a grasp of your surroundings.</p>

 <ul>
  <li>The first tunnel is completely dark. Nothing is visible.</li>
  
  <li>The second tunnel is bright, and warm. You can't distinguish any specific shapes, but you hear a rumbling.</li>
  
  <li>In the third, you see the sky. No clouds, just blue.</li>
  
  <li>The fourth seems to lead to a waterfall of some sort.</li></ul>

  <p>Which will you choose?</p>
